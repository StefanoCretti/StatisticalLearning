\chapter{What is statistical learning?}
  
  \section{Definition of statistical learning}
    In general, a statistical learning problem can be formalized as follows:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item $Y$ : response/dependent/outcome variable
      \item $\vec{X} = (X_1, \dots, X_p)$: vector of
      predictors/features/independent variables/covariates
    \end{itemize}
    We assume that there is a relationship between $Y$ and $\vec{X}$, which can
    be written as:

    $$Y = f(\vec{X}) + \varepsilon $$ Where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $f(\vec{X})$ is the deterministic (but unknown) function of the
      vector $\vec{X} = (X_1, \dots, X_p)$
      \item $\varepsilon$ is the error (stochastic part), for which we assume
      the following properties:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] $E[\varepsilon] = 0$ (Its expected value is zero)
        \item[$\bullet$] $\varepsilon \perp \vec{X}$ (It is independent from
        $\vec{X}$)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    the $\epsilon$ value represents the stochastic error, which is the estimated
    error in a model that arises from the exclusion of an important explanatory
    variable or due to incorrect specification. Therefore, the expression
    \textbf{statistical learning} encompasses different methods to estimate
    $f(\vec{X})$. 

  \section{Why estimate \textit{f}?} There are two main reasons to estimate $f$,
    those two being \textbf{prediction} and \textbf{inference}.
  
    \subsection{Prediction}
      Predict $Y$ when we only have observations about $\vec{X}$. Since
      $E[\varepsilon] = 0$, we usually take:

      $$\hat{Y} = \hat{f} (\vec{X})$$

      With $\hat{f}$ being our estimate of $f$.
      
      If this is the only reason to estimate $f$, then $\hat{f}$ can be a
      \textit{\textbf{black-box}} method (deep learning). The accuracy of
      $\hat{Y}$ as a predictor of $Y$ can be described calculating the expected
      \textbf{MSE}, the test Mean Squared Error. %#TODO ref image:

      \begin{align*}
        E[(Y&-\hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2 \,|\, \vec{X} = \vec{x}\,] = 
        & \text{where } \hat{f} \text{ is a fixed known function}\\
        & = E[(f(\vec{X}) + \varepsilon - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2]
        & \text{since } Y = f(\vec{X}) + \varepsilon \\
        & = E[(f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X})) + \varepsilon)^2]
        & \text{rearranging} \\
        & = E[(f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2 + \varepsilon^2 + 2\varepsilon(f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))]
        & \text{solving the square} \\
        & = E[(f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2] + E[\varepsilon^2] + 2E[\varepsilon(f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))]
        & \text{separating the expectations}
      \end{align*}
      
      Furthermore, since we know that:
      \begin{align*}
        Var(\varepsilon) 
        & = E[(\varepsilon - E(\varepsilon))^2]
        & \text{formal definition of variance} \\
        & = E[\epsilon^2 + (E(\epsilon))^2 - 2E(\epsilon)\epsilon]
        & \text{solving the square} \\
        & = E[\varepsilon^2] - (E[\varepsilon])^2  %shouldn't it be a +??? #TODO
        & \text{definition generally used during calculation} \\
        & = E[\varepsilon^2] 
        & \text{since } E[\varepsilon] = 0 \\
      \end{align*}

      Thus we get:
      \begin{align*}
        E[(Y&-\hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2 \,|\, \vec{X} = \vec{x}\,] = \\
        & = E[(f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2] + Var(\varepsilon) + 2E[\varepsilon(f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))]
        & \text{substituting } E[\varepsilon^2] = Var(\varepsilon) \\
        & = (f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2 + Var(\varepsilon) + 2(f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))E[\varepsilon]
        & \text{since } f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}) \text{ is a constant}\\
        & = (f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2 + Var(\varepsilon)
        & \text{since } E[\varepsilon] = 0 \\
      \end{align*}

      With:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $(f(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2$ being the \textbf{reducible
        error}. The model choice can increase or reduce this value, hence it is
        mostly controllable.
        \item $Var(\varepsilon)$ being the \textbf{irreducible error}. This
        value depends on the innate randomness present in the data, hence you
        can only try and minimize it by deciding which variables to use in your
        prediction (but it will never be zero otherwise you would have a
        deterministic situation).
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Inference}
      Inference is used when you want to understand the relation between $Y$ and
      $\vec{X}$ (and not just be able to make predictions). Namely, inference
      answers questions such as:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Which predictors/factors are most associated with the
        response?}
        \item \textit{What is the relationship between $Y$ and $X_j$?}
      \end{itemize}

  \section{How to extimate \textit{f}?} Given some \textbf{training data}
    $(\vec{x}_i, y_i), \, i = 1, \dots, n$, where $\vec{x}_i = (x_{i1}, \dots,
    x_{ip})^t$ is the vector of observations of unit $i$ while $y_i$ is the
    response for unit $i$, broadly speaking there are two types of methods to
    estimate $f$: \textbf{parametric methods} and \textbf{non-parametric
    methods}.

    \subsection{Parametric methods}
      In order to use parametric methods, we make an assumption about the
      functional form of $f(\vec{X})$, that assumption being that the form of
      the function depends on some \textit{parameters} (which we can estimate).
      An example of parametric method is \textbf{linear regression}, which
      implies that $f(\vec{X})$ is in the form:

      $$f(\vec{X}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_p X_p$$
      Where the great $X$s represent the predictors. Given this assumption,
      statistical learning becomes \textbf{fitting} (or training) the model on
      the data, which means estimating the parameters $\hat{\beta_0},
      \hat{\beta_1}, \dots, \hat{\beta_p}$ such that:

      $$\hat{f}(\vec{X}) = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} X_1 + \hat{\beta_2} X_2
      + \dots + \hat{\beta_p} X_p$$

      The main disadvantage of these methods is that they may be \textbf{too
      restrictive}, as they would depend on a limited number of predictors.

      Notice that linear models are \underline{linear in the parameters}, not in
      the predictors, hence:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $f(X_1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_1^2 + \beta_3 X_1^3 +
        \varepsilon$ (polynomial regression) is a linear model.
        \item $f(X_1) = \beta_0 X_1^{\beta_1}$ is \underline{not} a linear
        model.
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Non-parametric methods}
      Non-parametric methods do not make any explicit assumption on the function
      form of $f(\vec{X})$. These methods want to estimate $f$ by getting as
      close as possible to the data, without being too \textit{rough or wiggly}
      (basically \textbf{overfitting}).

    \subsection{Parametric vs non-parametric methods}
      Despite parametric methods being more restrictive than non-parametric
      ones, we might still choose to adopt them for the sake of interpretability
      and generalizability outside of the training data. %TODO
      % sezione ampliabile. #TODO

  \section{Bias-variance trade-off}

    Assume you have some data pairs in the form $(x_i, y_i), \, i = 1, \dots,
    n$; you can then define the estimate function $\hat{f}(x)$ as a linear model
    with up to $n-1$ parameters (more parameters give the same result as $n-1$
    parameters) and an intercept value. You could thus use, for instance, the
    models:
    \begin{align*}
      & 1 \text{ parameter}    &f(x) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \varepsilon \\
      & 2 \text{ parameters}   &f(x) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2 + \varepsilon \\
      & \vdots                 &     &\vdots \\
      & n-1 \text{ parameters} &f(x) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2 + \dots + \beta_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \varepsilon \\
    \end{align*}

    You could choose the model with the highest number of parameters; this model
    would explain all the variance of the training data ($R^2=1$) yet it would
    be very complex and perform badly with new data points. On the other hand a
    model with a lower number of parameters would explain less of the variance
    of the training data, yet it could perform better with new data points. \\\\

    Keeping in mind that $Y$ is random and that $\hat{f}$ is a random variable
    estimated from the data, when using the general formula to determine how
    well a model performs at generic $\vec{X}$, we notice:
    \begin{align*}
      E[(Y&-\hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2 \,|\, \vec{X} = \vec{x}\,] = \\
      & = E[(f(\vec{X}) + \varepsilon - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2] 
      & \text{since } Y = f(\vec{X}) + \varepsilon \\
      & = E[(f(\vec{X}) + \varepsilon - \hat{f}(\vec{X}) + E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])^2]
      & \text{since } E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] = 0\\
      & = E[((f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])+ \varepsilon + (E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - \hat{f}(\vec{X})))^2]
      & \text{grouping, square of three elements}\\
      & = E[(f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])^2] + E[\varepsilon^2] + E[(E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2] \, +
      & \\
      & \;\;\;\, + 2E[(f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])\,\varepsilon] \, + & \\
      & \;\;\;\, + 2E[(f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])(E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))] \, + 
      & \text{solving the square and}\\
      & \;\;\;\, + 2E[(E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))\,\varepsilon] \,
      & \text{dividing the expectations}\\
    \end{align*}

    But notice that:
    \begin{align*}
      E[(f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])\,\varepsilon] 
      & = E[\varepsilon](f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})]) 
      & \text{since } f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] \text{ is constant}\\
      & = 0
      & \text{since } E[\varepsilon] = 0 \\
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
      E[(f(\vec{X}) & - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])(E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))] = \\
                    & = (f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])E[E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - \hat{f}(\vec{X})]
                    & \text{since } f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] \text{ is constant} \\
                    & = (f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])E[ \hat{f}(\vec{X}) - \hat{f}(\vec{X})]
                    & \text{since } \hat{f}(\vec{X}) \text{ is a constant} \\
                    & = (f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])E[0] \\
                    & = 0
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
      E[(E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))\,\varepsilon]
      & = E[\varepsilon]E[E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - \hat{f}(\vec{X})]
      & \text{since } \varepsilon \perp \vec{X} \implies E[\varepsilon\vec{X}] = E[\varepsilon]E[\vec{X}]\\
      & = 0
      & \text{since } E[\varepsilon] = 0 \\
    \end{align*}
    
    Therefore we can simplify as:
    \begin{align*}
    E[(Y-\hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2 \,|\, \vec{X} = \vec{x}\,]
    & = E[(f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])^2] &+ &E[\varepsilon^2] &+ &E[(E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})] - \hat{f}(\vec{X}))^2] \\
    & = f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])^2 &+ &Var(\varepsilon) &+ &Var(\hat{f}(\vec{X})) 
    \end{align*} 
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $f(\vec{X}) - E[\hat{f}(\vec{X})])^2$ is the \textbf{bias}
      \item $Var(\varepsilon)$ is the \textbf{irreducible error}
      \item $Var(\hat{f}(\vec{X}))$ is the \textbf{variance} of the model
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Bias} is the amount that a model’s prediction differs from the
    target value, compared to the training data. Generally bias is consequently
    results from simplifying the assumptions used in a model. If an estimated
    model performs well on multiple data sets, the estimated model has low bias.
    \textit{High bias means that an estimated model is far from the real model}.
    \\\\
    \textbf{Variance} refers instead to the amount by which $\hat{f}$ would
    change if we estimated it using a different training data set. Ideally, the
    $\hat{f}$ calculated through different datasets should be not significantly
    different, the model should be fitted equivalently using a different
    training dataset. The more flexible models, the more they are influenced by
    a changes of the training dataset. \\\\

    \begin{figure}[h]
      \caption{  
      As the flexibility of a model increases, the Bias decreases, and the
      varaiance of the model increases}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{MSEdependsonVarianceandBias}
      \label{MSEVarianceBias}
      \end{figure}

    In order to minimize the expected error, we need to achieve low bias and low
    variance. In practice, one needs to find a good \textbf{trade-off} between
    bias and variance, since reducing one often involves increasing the other.
    In general:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A \textbf{simpe model} has high bias (it is far from the real model)
      and low variance (when fitting using different training data you get
      similar estimated parameters).
      \item A \textbf{complex model} has low bias and high variance, as the
      complexity of the model has the aim of making it as near as possible to
      the real $ f $.
    \end{itemize}
    Both in parametric and non-parametric methods, you generally have at least
    one \textbf{tuning parameter}, which is a parameter that can be tweaked (for
    instance the degree of the polinomial) in order to choose the balance
    between bias and variance.
