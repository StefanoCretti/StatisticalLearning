  \section{Definition of statistical decision theory}
    The \textbf{statistical decision theory} is a set of quantitative methods
    for reaching optimal decisions for well posed problems. \underline{Statistical decision
    theory applies to supervised learning}, while it does not apply to
    unsupervised learning. For most of the course we will focus on supervised
    learning
    (\href{https://www.britannica.com/science/decision-theory-statistics}{decision
    theory statistics from Britannica}). 

  \section{Supervised learning}
    \textbf{Supervised learning} is a set of methods whose objective is, given
    the observations $(\vec{x}_i, y_i)$ with $i = 1, \dots, n$, to \textbf{find
    a rule $\hat{f}$ that allows us to predict $Y$ from $\vec{X}$}, meaning that
    $\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(\vec{X})$. $\hat{f}(\vec{X})$ is thus an approximation of
    the true rule $f(\vec{X})$. Finding $\hat{f}$ corresponds to training (or
    fitting) a model using labelled data pairs (both predictors and response
    values are known). In this case, the term \textit{fitting} refers to
    adjusting the parameters in the model to improve the accuracy. \textit{Model
    fitting}, insted, is the measure of how well a machine learning model
    generalizes data similar to that with which it was trained. A good model fit
    refers to a model that accurately approximates the output when it is
    provided with unseen inputs. \\

    %#TODO add image already present

    Broadly, there are two main types of methods of supervised learning: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Regression methods}, in which the response $Y$ is
      quantitative (numerical). In this case $\hat{f}$ is called
      \textbf{\textit{regression function}}.
      \item \textbf{Classification methods}, in which the response $Y$ is
      qualitative (categorical). In this case $\hat{f}$ is called
      \textbf{\textit{classifier}}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    The predictors ($\vec{X}$) can take any form, numerical or categorical. In
    general there are no assumptions on the form of the predictors (but not
    always).
    \\\\
    To evaluate a model you use \textbf{loss functions}, which are functions
    used to \underline{penalize the differences between $Y$ and
    $\hat{f}(\vec{X})$}. Many loss functions can be used; the choice of a
    specific loss function determines which function is considered to be the
    true rule $f(\vec{X})$ (since this moment I will refer $\hat{f}(x)$ as
    $f(x)$).

  \section{Regression setting}
    In a regression setting, the loss function which is generally used is the
    \textbf{squared error loss function} (also referred as the risk of
    estimating $ Y $ using $ \hat{f}(\vec{X}) $), which is defined as:
    $$L(Y,f(\vec{X})) = (Y-f(\vec{X}))^2$$ When using this loss function, the
    criterion for choosing the model becomes finding $f$ such that it minimizes
    the \textbf{expected prediction error} (EPE), which is the expected value of
    the squared error loss function:
    \begin{align*}
      \text{EPE}(f) & = E_{Y,\vec{X}}[(Y-f(\vec{X}))^2] \\
                    & = \iint (y - f(\vec{x}))^2 g_{Y,\vec{X}}(y, \vec{x})\,dy\,d\vec{x} & \text{\textbf{if} } Y \text{ \textbf{is continuous}}
    \end{align*}
    This error is an expectation since you usually do not know the distribution
    of $Y$ and $\vec{X}$. If Y is continuous you can rewrite this expectation as
    the double integral times the joint density function $g_{Y,\vec{X}}(y, \vec{x})$.\\
    
    \begin{theorem}[Minimum of the expected prediction error]
      $\text{EPE}(f) = E_{Y,\vec{X}}[(Y-f(\vec{X}))^2]$ has a \textbf{minimum}
      when $f(\vec{x}) = E[Y|\vec{X} = \vec{x}]$. $f(\vec{x})$ is called
      regression function.
    \end{theorem}
    % TODO Maybe it is needed to add pedices to the expectations

    \begin{proof}
      (Sketch) By definition we know that
      $$\text{EPE}(f) = E_{Y,\vec{X}}[(Y-f(\vec{X}))^2]$$

      Then, because of the law of \textit{iterated expectations} we get

      $$E_{Y,\vec{X}}[(Y-f(\vec{X}))^2] =
      E_{\vec{X}}[E_{Y|\vec{X}}[(Y-f(\vec{X}))^2]| \vec{X}]$$
      
      If we then consider a specific value of $\vec{X}$, meaning $\vec{X} =
      \vec{x}$, the inner expectation becomes 
      
      $$E[(Y-f(\vec{x}))^2 | \vec{X} = \vec{x}\,] $$
      
      But since $\vec{x}$ is fixed, $f(\vec{x})$ is a constant, hence this
      expectation can be written as a function in some parameter $a$

      $$g(a) = E_{Y}[(Y-a)^2]$$

      Then we want to find the (constant) value of $a$ that minimizes $g(a)$
      \begin{align*}
        g(a) & = E_{Y}[(Y-a)^2]               & \\
             & = E[Y^2 - 2aY + a^2]           & \text{compute the square} \\
             & = E[Y^2] -2aE[Y] + E[a^2]      & \text{separate expectations} \\
             & = E[Y^2] -2aE[Y] + a^2         & \text{pull out } a^2 \text{ since constant} \\
      \end{align*}

      Then, setting the derivative to zero we get 

      $$\frac{dg}{da} = -2E[Y] + 2a \mbeq 0 \implies \hat{a} = E[Y]$$

      Notice that if you plug $\hat{a}$ into $g(a) = E_{Y}[(Y-a)^2]$ you get

      $$g(\hat{a}) = E_{Y}[(Y-E[Y])^2] = Var(Y)$$
      
      Since $a = E[Y]$, the function that minimizes the $ g(a) $ function and
      consequently the EPE is 

      $$f(\vec{x}) = E[Y|\vec{X} = \vec{x}]$$
    \end{proof}
    % TODO Some steps could be clearer

    In a regression setting you could use other loss functions, such as the
    \textit{absolute error loss} function
    $$L(Y|f(\vec{X})) = |Y - f(\vec{X})|$$ which is used in \textbf{least
    absolute deviation} (LAD) regression. In this case \textbf{$f(\vec{x})$ is the
    median of $Y$ given $\vec{x}$}, therefore you have a model which is more
    robust to outliers.
\\\\
    We will choose the squared error loss and this motivates how the methods are
    developed. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Linear regression} (parametric regression) can be expressed
      as 

      \begin{align*}
        Y|\vec{X} = \vec{x} \sim N(\vec{x}^t\vec{\beta}, \sigma^2) && \text{Meaning that \vec{x} is composed of }%#TODO comprendi bene questa espressione
      \end{align*}

      or focusing more on the conditional mean
      $$E[Y|\vec{X} = \vec{x}] = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \dots +
            \beta_px_p$$
      \item \textbf{K-nearest neighbours regression}: one of the most used
      non-parametric regression
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{K-nearest neighbours regression (KNN)}
    
      In the scope of regression, K-nearest neighbours method is defined as

      \begin{equation}
        \hat{f}(\vec{x}) = \text{Average}(y_i | \vec{x_i} \in N_K(\vec{x})) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{x_i \in N_{\vec{x}}}{y_i}
      \end{equation}

      Where:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Average is the sample mean
        \item $N_K(\vec{x})$ is the neighbourhood of $K$ points closest to
        $\vec{x}$
        \item $K$ is an integer
      \end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{The training data are shown in blue dots, test data and predictions of test data are star-shaped. The predicted value on test data is given making the average of the neighbours' values}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{KNNregression}
\end{figure}


      This method makes two approximations:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item It uses sample mean to approximate population mean
        \item It uses a neighbourhood of $\vec{x}$ rather than only $\vec{x}$
      \end{itemize}
      
      This method works well if you have a high amount of data and the number of
      parameters ($p$) is small. This simple method is rarely used, but it has
      inspired the development of more sophisticated kernel methods.

  \section{Classification setting}
    In a classification setting the response \textit{$Y$ is categorical}, with $K$
    categories. A \textbf{classifier} is deciding which class to assign to a new
    observation $\vec{x}$. In this case $\hat{Y}$ is the predicted class.
    
    An example of loss function that can be used in classificiation setting is
    the \textbf{$0$-$1$ loss function} which penalizes classifying a datapoint in
    the wrong class. Assume for instance the binary case, meaning $K = 2$ (but
    you could generalize for any number of classes); in that case the $0$-$1$ loss
    function can be represented as:
    
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|}
	\hline
	\textbf{True value, Prediction} & \textbf{0} & \textbf{1} \\
	\hline
	\hline
	\textbf{0} &  $0$ & $1$ \\
	\hline
	\textbf{\textbf{1}} & $1$ & $0$\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{This is the table representing the possible values of the $0$-$1$ loss
function: $ L(Y, \hat{Y}(\vec{X})) $. $Y$ is the true class, while instead
$\hat{Y}(\vec{X})$ is the predicted class.}
\end{table} 
    
    Notice that this function penalizes the same way all the misclassified
    observations (it assigns them the value 1).  
    
    Using the 0-1 loss function, the criterion for choosing the model becomes
    finding the classifying function $\hat{Y}$, dependent on $\vec{X}$, that
    \textbf{minimizes the expected 0-1 loss function} when applied to every
    possible value $ \vec{x} $. In practice, we want to find the function $\hat{Y}$
    so that the expected value $ E[L(Y, \hat{Y}(\vec{X}))]$ is the minor.

    To find $\hat{Y}$, let us consider just one $\vec{x}$, therefore the problem
    becomes minimizing 

    $$E[L(Y, \hat{Y}(\vec{x}))] = \sum_{k=1}^k L(k, \hat{Y}(\vec{x})) \;
    p(k|\vec{x})$$

	[This equation means that $ E[L(Y, \hat{Y}(\vec{x}))] $, is equal to the sum
    of all the possible values of the loss function (calculated for each class
    with respect to the predicted class) multiplied by the probability of that
    class given $ \vec{x} $]. Then, considering the binary case (with two
    possible classes $0$ and $1$), if the classifier predicts $\vec{x}$ to
    belong to class 0 ($\hat{y} = 0$), we have 

    \begin{align*}
      E[L(Y,0)] & = L(0,0)p(0|\vec{x}) + L(1, 0)p(1|\vec{x}) \\
                & = 0 \cdot p(0|\vec{x}) + 1 \cdot p(1|\vec{x}) \\
                & = p(1|\vec{x})
    \end{align*}

Logically, $ E[L(Y,0)] $ will be the loss value (1) multiplied by the
probability of \vec{x} belonging to class 1, Y = 1. On the other hand, if the
classifier predicts $\vec{x}$ to belong to the class 1, $p(1|\vec{x})$, we have

    \begin{align*}
      E[L(Y,1)] & = L(0,1)p(0|\vec{x}) + L(1, 1)p(1|\vec{x}) \\
                & = 1 \cdot p(0|\vec{x}) + 0 \cdot p(1|\vec{x}) \\
                & = p(0|\vec{x})
    \end{align*}

    Predicting $\vec{x}$ to the class that minimizes the expected 1-0 loss
    results in classifying $\vec{x}$ to class 1 if $p(1|\vec{x}) >
    p(0|\vec{x})$. Since $p(0|\vec{x}) = 1 - p(1|\vec{x})$, we can write
    $$p(1|\vec{x}) > 1 - p(1|\vec{x}) \implies 2p(1|\vec{x}) > 1 \implies
    p(1|\vec{x})>0.5$$ Therefore, in the binary case, $\vec{x}$ is predicted to
    belong to the class with more than $0.5$ probability (which is intuitive).

    In general ($k$ classes), the 0-1 loss is minimized by the \textbf{bayes
    classifier}, which states to assign $\vec{x}$ to class $j$ where 

    $$j = \argmax_{i\,\in\,classes} p(Y = j|\vec{X} = \vec{x})$$

    (Which means assigning $\vec{x}$ to the class with the highest probability).
    This approach tells us how to set the problem, but it does not give any
    information on the probabilities, which have to be estimated by the single
    method.

    To rewrite the binary case in another way:
    $$
    \text{assign } \vec{x} \text{ to class} 
    \begin{cases}
      1 \text{ if } p(1|\vec{x}) > 0.5\\
      0 \text{ if } p(1|\vec{x}) < 0.5
    \end{cases}
    $$
    
    % TODO add decision boundary graph
    The line formed by the points with probability $p(1|\vec{x}) = 0.5$ is
    called \textbf{bayes decision boundary} or \textbf{decision surface}.
    
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Bayes decision boundary in green. In the simplest case, when we have two classes with equivalent
probability, $ p(1 | \vec{x}) = p(0 | \vec{x} = 0.5 )$}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{BayesDecisionBoundary}
\end{figure}

    The \textbf{bayes error rate} (BER) is the probability of committing an
    error when classifying observations. It is defined as:
    
    $$\text{BER } = 1 - E_{\vec{X}}\left(\max_{j} p(j|\vec{x})\right)$$
    
(Since the class with the highest probability is the one considered by us to
classify observations, the probability of getting an error is equal to the total
probability subtracted with the probability used to assign the class).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{The figure on the left represents the best possible scenario, as the BES value is 0, and the decision surface separate completely the elements belonging to the two classes. The graph on the left instead shows an intermadiate situation, where $ BER \neq 0 $}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{BERBayesErrorRate}
\label{BER}
\end{figure}

    We talk about \textbf{perfect separation} of the classes (figure \ref{BER}) when 
    $$\max_{j} p(j|\vec{x}) = 1 \implies \text{ BER } = 0$$ In this case it is
    possible to classify any $\vec{x}$ without error. Generally, \textbf{$\text{BER } > 0$}, therefore you have some irreducible error
    due to a partial overlap of the classes.
\\\\
    It is possible to use a more generic loss function, called
    \textbf{misclassification loss function}, which can be represented (if $K =
    2$) as:
    
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{This is the table representing the possible values of $ L(Y,
\hat{Y}(\vec{X})) $. $c_0$ and $c_1$ represent two different cost values}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|}
	\hline
	\textbf{True value, Predictions} & \textbf{0} & \textbf{1} \\
	\hline
	\hline
	\textbf{0} &  $0$ & $c_0$ \\
	\hline
	\textbf{\textbf{1}} & $c_1$ & $0$\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table} 

    This loss function is analogous to the 0-1 loss function, but it assigns
    \textbf{different weights to different errors}, therefore the
    misclassifications have different costs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $c_0$ is the misclassification cost of misclassifying a class 0 to 1
      \item $c_1$ is the misclassification cost of misclassifying a class 1 to 0
    \end{itemize}
    Just like the 0-1 loss function, misclassification loss function can be
    generalized for $K$ classes. This loss function is generally better than the
    0-1 loss function since\textbf{\textit{in real situations it is likely for
    misclassifications to have different relevance}} (credit risk evaluation,
    medical context and others). Moreover, this loss function allows you to
    adjust for unbalanced classes. Consider for example a rare disease; consider
    the $1$ value to be indicative of the ill state, and 0 of the healthy state.
    We would obtain in all the cases
    
    \begin{align*}
      E[L(Y,0)] &= L(1, 0)p(1|\vec{x}) &&\text{prediction for the $0$ (healthy) class}\\
      &<<<\: E[L(Y,1)] = L(0, 1)p(0|\vec{x}) &&\text{$\dots$ for the $1$ (ill) class}
    \end{align*}
    $$ $$
    
    since $p(1|\vec{x})$ is really low, and consequently, using a 0-1 loss
    function results in a model which always classifies patients as healty.
    The model would be almost always correct, but it does not perform well when
    trying to determine which patients are affected by the disease. When using
    misclassification loss function, you can instead increase the weight of the
    misclassification "classify a patient as healthy when they are not", which
    may lead to worse results in terms of identifying healthy patients, but way
    better results in terms of identifying diseased patients.
    
    Repeating the same steps used for 0-1 loss function, we can determine the
    threshold for the misclassification function (for $k=2$ but it can be
    generalized)
    $$E[L(Y,0)] = c_1 p(1|\vec{x}) \text{ and } E[L(Y,1)] = c_0 p(0|\vec{x})$$
  
    Therefore we assign $\vec{x}$ to class 1 if 

    $$c_1 p(1|\vec{x}) > c_0 p(0|\vec{x})$$

    But since $p(0|\vec{x}) = 1 - p(1|\vec{x})$, we can instead write
    \begin{align*}
    c_1 p(1|\vec{x}) &> c_0 - c_0 p(1|\vec{x})) \\
    p(1|\vec{x}) &> \frac{c_0}{c_0 + c_1}
    \end{align*}
    which is the \textbf{classification threshold}.

  \section{Model accuracy}
    In practice, we would use our chosen method to estimate
    $f(\vec{x})=E[Y|\vec{X}=\vec{x}]$ (regression) or $p(1|\vec{x})$
    (classification) from training data $(\vec{x}_i, y_i), \; i = 1, \dots, n$.
    The \textbf{accuracy} of the model is typically measured on some
    \textbf{test data} $(\vec{x}_i^{(t)}, y_i^{(t)}), \, i = 1, \dots, m $.

    Therefore, a regression that uses MSE has for accuracy
    $$\text{MSE } = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m}\left(y_i^{(t)} -
                    \hat{f}\left(\vec{x}_i^{(t)}\right)\right)^2$$
    
    
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|}
	\hline
	\textbf{True value, Predictions} & \textbf{0} & \textbf{1} \\

	\hline
	\textbf{\textbf{1}} & $ FN $ & $ TP $ \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Confusion matrix}
\label{ConfMat}
\end{table} 

    Meanwhile, for a classification, you create a \textbf{confusion matrix}
    (table \ref{ConfMat}), estimate the probabilities via some method,
    substitute the values into the following formulas to obtain
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \caption{graphical explanation for dummy guys} %#TODO togli
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{SensitivityandSpecificity}
      \label{sensitivSpecificity}
      \end{figure}

    \textbf{sensitivity and specificity} (figure \ref{sensitivSpecificity}).
     
    \begin{align*}
      &\text{\textbf{True positive rate (TPR)}} &= \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP } + \text{ FN}} 
      &= \text{ \textbf{sensitivity}}\\
      &\text{\textbf{False positive rate (FPR)}} 
      &= \frac{\text{FP}}{\text{FN } + \text{ FP}} 
      &= 1 - \frac{\text{TN}}{\text{TN } + \text{ FP}} = 1 - \text{ \textbf{specificity}} \\\\
      &\text{\textbf{Error rate}} &= \frac{\text{FP } + \text{ FN}}{m}
    \end{align*}

    
    Notice that this last formula only works when using a 1-0 loss function; if
    you are using a misclassification loss function, the formula is similar but
    weighted:
    $$\text{Misclassification cost}= \frac{c_0 \text{ FP} + c_1 \text{ FN}}{m}$$

    Since defining the exact costs of the misclassifications might prove
    difficult, a possible approach is using the \textbf{Receiver Operating
    Characteristic (ROC) curve}. Basically you plot all the pairs (FPR, TPR) you
    obtain by varying the classification threshold from 0 to 1; you will then
    obtain a curve from which you can decide which value to use as a threshold
    (the one you see fit for your needs of specificity and sensibility). 
   
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Image taken from Wikipedia. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{RocCurve}
\label{ROCcurve}
\end{figure}

    Different models have different ROC curves. The best possible curve would
    touch the top left corner (figure \ref{ROCcurve}), meaning that you never
    misclassify any observation and therefore the model is deterministic. The
    worst possibile curve corresponds to the diagonal (from bottom left to top
    right corner), meaning that you have a 1/2 chance of misclassifying the
    observation (the same as tossing a coin to decide). The \textbf{Area Under
    the Curve (AUC)} is the area between the curve and the main diagonal. Its
    value goes from $0$ in the worst case to $0.5$ in the best one. For these
    reasons, you want a curve that is as high as possible (and thus has the
    biggest possible AUC). When choosing between two models, if the ROC curve of
    one of the models is always above the ROC of the other model, the former one
    is the strictly better one; if the two ROC curves intersect, you choose the
    model whose curve is the highest in the region you are most interested in
    (based on sensibility and specificity).
